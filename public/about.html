<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Which one's your pop? It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Lorraine. Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.</p>

<p>Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What? My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.</p>

<p>George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. C'mon, c'mon. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?</p>
